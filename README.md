#### About Dataset:
The Dataset of the flight records in USA is available on http://statcomputing.
org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html. The data is available from year 1987 to 2008.
It has many columns which can be helpful in Map Reduction analysis. Once it is done, more
analysis on the basis of aggregation or various important points can be done using Pig, Hive,
HBase.
